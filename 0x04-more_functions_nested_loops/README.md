File 7 is a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

File 8 is a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

File 9 is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line, but for multiples of three prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints Buzz.

File 10 is a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

File 11 is a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
